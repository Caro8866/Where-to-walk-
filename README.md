**Project Description**
Every day when i need to decide where to walk my dog, i get decision fatigue and frustrated. In order to solve this daily occurance I built this!
A "app" (not a app yet, just a webpage), where i am able to sort through dog walk options, filter them and get a random selection.

**Built using**

- HTML
- CSS
- JAVASCRIPT
- Wordpress database & PODS plugin

**Steps to makings it work**

- Create FIGMA mockup of style
- Set up database
- Set up HTML
- Style using CSS (experiment with a different language?)
- Link to database
- show list of options
- filter by different things: walk length, dog amount, how far away? (make responsive inregards to current location), ...
- random button to randomise selection.
